        Like a fire extinguisher, a table of contents is important to have even if it doesn't get used often. Even if nobody reads a report, a magazine, a book, or anything else for the table of contents, it is an essential tool in a longer work to help readers find what they need. Some readers also use the table of contents as part of their pre-reading, to get an overview of the subject matter. Regardless of how it is used, the table of contents provides a map for whatever you're reading, because it outlines exactly where the paper is going, what will be discussed, and where to go to find specific information. Therefore, it is important that any tables of contents you write are useful, succinct, and accurate.
